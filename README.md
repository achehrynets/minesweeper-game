# Console Mode
In console mode, the game is played entirely in the console. The player is presented with a grid of hidden squares, some of which contain mines. The player must uncover squares to reveal what is underneath them. If the player uncovers a mine, the game is over. The goal is to uncover all squares that do not contain mines.

To play the game in console mode, run the following command:
`java -jar minesweeper-game.jar console`

# GUI Mode
In GUI mode, the game is played using a graphical user interface. The player can click on squares to uncover them, and right-click to flag squares that they believe contain mines. The player can also click on the smiley face icon to restart the game at any time.


To play the game in GUI mode, run the following command:
`java -jar minesweeper-game.jar gui`
